BioAI Detector Machine

BioAI Detector Machine is an educational web-based project that demonstrates how artificial intelligence and image classification can be applied in biology and basic health analysis. It allows users to train a machine learning model in the browser and test it using uploaded images.

Purpose

This project was created for a biology winter fair to showcase how AI can recognize patterns in biological and medical-related images. It is designed for learning and demonstration only.

Features

Train an AI model using custom image datasets

Real-time image prediction with confidence percentages

Multiple detection categories:

Broken vs normal bones

Cancer cell images

Dental health conditions

Skin conditions

Eye infections

Instructional feedback after each result

Runs fully in the browser (no server required)

How It Works

The system uses a pre-trained neural network for feature extraction and allows users to create classifiers for different categories. Users upload images, train the model, and test new images to see prediction results instantly.

Instructions Output

After each prediction, the system displays a guidance message explaining what the result may indicate. These messages are informational only and not medical advice.
